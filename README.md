<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# ABOUT THE PROJECT
Computer Vision and Machine Learning are ruling in every other industry, so why not in Yoga Industry. Yoga is something that adds years to your life and automatically life to your years.

### OBJECTIVE
Human Pose Estimation is trending nowadays. Our objective is to develop a unique and useful application for all yoga enthusiasts. We build a one to one interactive system which not only tracks/checks but also guides and corrects people while doing yoga. Additionally, we build a unique system to keep users motivated, to excite them to indulge Yoga in their practice.

### MOTIVATION
* Are you in need of a PERSONAL yoga trainer ??
      *Who can instruct, guide and correct you...*
  Because you feel shy to do in front of others…
OR
* Are you a LAZY person who avoids doing yoga even after knowing the importance of yoga ??
      *Because you are not motivated enough…*

Don’t worry, We’re there to help you !!

### SOLUTION
We bring an exciting project which is "YogFun" that brings out a real-time, one-to-one experience for all the yoga enthusiasts to enjoy doing yoga in their homes with a virtual trainer and compete with their friends over a game of yoga.

There are two major components of our project:
(i) Yoga Practice Sessions
(ii) Multi Player Yoga Game

#### 1. Yoga Practice Sessions
It provides a platform for yoga enthusiasts to practice the yoga pose with a virtual trainer. All you have to do is, just choose a yoga pose you want to form and open the camera. Next, the virtual trainer will itself instruct and guide you on how to form the pose step by step. It will not only just check whether you are moving your limbs or not, but also track you and correct you whenever you are doing wrong while forming the pose. The practice session guides the users on forming the yoga pose perfectly and helps them to be agile and flexible.

#### 2. Multi Player Yoga Game
The game includes peer-to-peer connection of the friends in which a virtual room is created where they select a group of yoga poses to be performed and a backend model is run that tracks everyone in the room and determines the accuracy percentage of every user doing yoga. In the end, the leaderboard is displayed with the winning data. This gaming feature helps the yoga enthusiasts to stay motivated for doing yoga and creates a fun moment between the friends since it brings out a real-life experience for the people as if they are all doing yoga together in a real physical room.
